# REQUIREMENT

## Overview

`spec-while` is a single-feature, task-by-task orchestrator built around a task source protocol.

It consumes:

- the `specs/<feature>/...` directory layout
- the files required by the configured task source

The only public workflow configuration entry is `while.yaml`.

The current built-in task source is `spec-kit`, which consumes:

- `spec.md`
- `plan.md`
- `tasks.md`

It does not execute the Spec Kit command runtime. It does not run Spec Kit hooks, checklists, or skill installations.

## Workflow Preset

An optional `while.yaml` at the workspace root configures task source and workflow behavior.

Current configuration surface:

```yaml
task:
  source: spec-kit
  maxIterations: 5

workflow:
  mode: direct
  roles:
    implementer:
      provider: codex
    reviewer:
      provider: codex
```

Current support level:

- `task.source: spec-kit` is the only built-in source today
- `task.maxIterations` is a global retry budget applied to every task
- `direct` uses a local reviewer and local integrate
- `pull-request` uses a remote GitHub PR reviewer and squash merge integrate

## Workspace Resolution

The current working directory is the workspace root and must contain a `specs/` directory.

If `cwd/specs` does not exist, the CLI fails with a clear user-facing error.

Feature resolution order:

1. `--feature`
2. current git branch prefix
3. the only feature directory under `specs/`

## Commands

### `spec-while run`

- initializes `.while` for the feature when no state exists
- resumes from existing `.while/state.json` when state already exists
- requires a clean worktree
- supports `--until-task`

### `spec-while rewind --task <taskSelector>`

- requires the target task to be `done`
- requires a clean worktree
- resets git to the parent of the task commit
- deletes and rebuilds the feature `.while` directory

## Task Graph

The selected task source exposes task handles and dependencies, and the orchestrator derives a validated task topology from that protocol.

For the built-in `spec-kit` source, a valid task is any raw task line matching the generated Spec Kit list format, such as:

```md
- [ ] T001 Implement greeting
- [ ] T003 [P] Add tests
- [ ] T010 [P] [US1] Add scenario coverage
```

The built-in `spec-kit` source:

- preserves task order from `tasks.md`
- records the nearest `##` heading as the task phase label
- does not parse enhanced fields like `Depends`, `Acceptance`, `Review Rubric`, `Goal`, or `storyId`
- exposes no explicit dependencies from raw task lines, so built-in `spec-kit` tasks execute in file order unless later task sources provide dependency data

Validation rejects:

- duplicate task handles
- unknown dependencies
- dependency cycles
- missing required task lines
- invalid global retry counts

## Agent Contract

The orchestrator uses two agent roles:

- implement
- review

Implement receives:

- `generation`
- `attempt`
- previous findings
- a task-source-built prompt

Review phase context receives:

- `generation`
- `attempt`
- previous findings
- a task-source-built prompt
- implement result
- `actualChangedFiles`

## Workflow Semantics

For each runnable task:

1. start a new attempt
2. run implement
3. run review
4. if review is approved, enter integrate
5. if integrate succeeds, apply the task source completion marker, create a git commit, mark the task as `done`, and record integrate artifacts in `.while`

The zero gate for completion requires:

- review verdict `pass`
- no findings
- all acceptance checks passing

## Git-First Completion

`done` means:

- the task passed implement and review
- the integrate stage succeeded

Each completed task creates one commit with a source-provided subject. For the built-in `spec-kit` source, the format is:

```text
Task <taskId>: <task title>
```

The commit includes source changes and the task source completion update.

In `pull-request` mode:

- review creates or reuses a task branch derived from `Task <taskId>: <title>`
- review creates a checkpoint commit with `checkpoint: Task <taskId>: <title> (attempt <n>)`
- review opens or reuses a PR against `main`
- review polls the PR every minute with no default timeout
- review collects a fully paginated live GraphQL PR snapshot before evaluating approval or active feedback
- the only supported remote reviewer actor is `chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]`
- approval requires the freshest `+1` reaction after the current checkpoint and no newer active feedback
- active feedback includes unresolved, non-outdated review threads plus reviewer-authored review summaries and discussion comments after the current checkpoint
- process restart during review or integrate re-enters the current pull-request stage instead of restarting `implement`
- if an open PR exists but the local task branch is missing, review/integrate restore the branch from `origin/<branch>`
- if the PR was already squash-merged before state was persisted, integrate treats the merged PR as already completed and finalizes local cleanup on resume
- integrate runs on the task branch, applies the task source completion marker when needed, squash-merges to `main`, then deletes the local task branch

The `.while` directory is excluded from task commits.

Completed task state stores `commitSha`.

## Rewind Semantics

`rewind` reverts both code and workflow state.

After git reset:

- tasks whose `commitSha` is still an ancestor of `HEAD` are restored as `done`
- all rolled-back tasks return to `pending`
- the explicitly rewound task and every rolled-back task enter a new `generation`
- `attempt` resets to `0` for those tasks

Task source completion markers are restored by git history, not by manual string edits. For the built-in `spec-kit` source, this means `tasks.md` checkboxes.

## Scope and Verification

`actualChangedFiles` are derived from git diff against `HEAD`.

In `pull-request` mode, review changed-file context comes from the live PR snapshot rather than the local worktree diff.

## Runtime Storage

Each feature stores runtime data under:

```text
specs/<feature>/.while/
```

The runtime layout includes:

- `state.json`
- `graph.json`
- `report.json`
- `events.jsonl`
- `tasks/<taskHandle>/g<generation>/a<attempt>/implement.json`
- `tasks/<taskHandle>/g<generation>/a<attempt>/review.json`
- `tasks/<taskHandle>/g<generation>/a<attempt>/integrate.json`

`.while` is runtime state, not the long-term source of truth.

For pull-request review recovery, the store must be able to reload the persisted `implement` artifact by `taskHandle + generation + attempt`.
